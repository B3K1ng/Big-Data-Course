Google Colab is a free cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment that allows you to write and execute Python code in your browser. It is particularly popular for machine learning and data analysis tasks due to its integration with Google Drive and support for GPU acceleration.
My Binder is a service that allows you to create and share interactive Jupyter notebooks. It enables you to run Jupyter notebooks in your browser without the need for installation or configuration. You can use My Binder to share your work with others or to run notebooks from GitHub repositories. Change to Jupyter Notebooks in My Binder are not saved, but you can download your work or save it to your own Drive by using the "Download" option in the File menu.

Jupyter notebooks are interactive documents that combine code, text, and visualizations. They are widely used in data science and research for their ability to present code alongside explanations and results.
